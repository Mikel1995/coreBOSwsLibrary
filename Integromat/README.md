# Integromat Integration

**coreBOS** counts with a very powerful and flexible integration with [Integromat](https://www.integromat.com) thanks to [Mikel Kasneci](https://github.com/Mikel1995). This integration will permit you to plugin your coreBOS with an [inmense set of applications](https://www.integromat.com/en/integrations).

You can add the coreBOS/Integromat application to your inventory [using this link](https://www.integromat.com/en/apps/invite/corebos-177516/687a9e813e7d0004c330bac080669286)

The coreBOS team would appreciate you created your Integromat account [using this affiliate link](https://www.integromat.com/?pc=corebos) as that will help support the project and keep us creating all this awesome software!

The code is open source and you can see the application inside Integromat and also on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/Mikel1995/coreBosToIntegromat).

**Enjoy!!**
